### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a phd student at Inria Flowers team. My work is to use reinforcement learning techniques to customize attention training protocols. 

Few things about me: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python project to teach genetic algorithm to cs students :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcement learning...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science !
