### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate PhD student currently working at the Inria Flowers team (see our work here: https://flowers.inria.fr/), where we explore the fascinating concept of intelligence in various ways. Whether it's through implementing computational models, observing human behavior, or developing interventions that involve humans and machines, I love the idea that we can one day unravel this well-oiled evolutionary mystery! One critical component of intelligence is the ability to learn, and my research focuses on studying the impact of intrinsic motivation ('what drives us to do something without expecting external rewards') on learning. Specifically, I am interested in using motivation-guided personalization algorithms to optimize educational sequences. I am always available to discuss these topics, so feel free to contact me anytime!

Few things about me: 

- ðŸ”­ Always looking for tools to automate my work
- ðŸŒ± I have developed a strong interest in generative AI, with a particular fascination for stable diffusion - I know, it's not the most original choice, but it's definitely captured my attention!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science !
